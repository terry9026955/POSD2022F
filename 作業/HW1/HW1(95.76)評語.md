# Grading Standards  #
Each method needs at least one unit test, so you should have at least 24 unit tests for all methods we designed, including the getters and setters of a class. We assigned 50 scores for your own test, so one test gained 2.08 scores.

The missed unit tests of methods are listed below:

## Point Test ##
* operator==()

## Rectangle Test ##
* constructor
