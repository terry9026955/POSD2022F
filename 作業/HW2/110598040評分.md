# Grading Standards  #
Each method needs at least one unit test, so you should have at least 27 unit tests for all methods we designed, including the getters and setters of a class. We assigned 50 scores for your own test, so one test gained 1.85 scores.

The missed unit tests of methods are listed below:

## Circle Test ##
* createDFSIterator()
* createBFSIterator()
* addShape()
* deleteShape()

## Rectangle Test ##
* createDFSIterator()
* createBFSIterator()
* addShape()
* deleteShape()

## Triangle Test ##
* createDFSIterator()
* createBFSIterator()
* addShape()
* deleteShape()

## Compound Shape Test ##
* area() *Not test the area of compound shape itself*
* perimeter() *Not test the perimeter of compound shape itself*
